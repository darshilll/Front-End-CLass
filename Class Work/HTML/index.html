    <p style="background-color: #90ee90;width: 600px;"><u>Cricket is the world's most upular bat-and-ball game,</u> it
        is played
        between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre of
        which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each
        comprising two bails balanced on <em style="color: red;">three stumps</em> . The game proceeds
        when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls"
        (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the
        other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally
        done so six times. The batting side has one player at each end of the
        pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler
        aiming to strike the ball with a bat.</p>
